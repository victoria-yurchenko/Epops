                        A junior developer is an entry-level programmer or software developer that assists a development team. Their duties include analyzing technical requirements, writing basic code, fixing bugs or error messages and collecting user feedback. Junior developers usually collaborate with one or more senior developers, who check their work and perform the more complicated coding tasks.

                    <h5>
                        <b>1. Learn to code</b>
                    </h5>
                    <hr/>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
                        Before you can become a junior developer, it's vital to learn the basics of common scripting languages. Junior developers are typically comfortable coding in a variety of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. You can pursue a computer science degree, participate in a coding boot camp program or teach yourself through online resources or textbooks on the subject.
                    </p>

                    <h5>
                        <b>2. Find an internship</b>
                    </h5>
                    <hr/>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
                        Most large software companies offer internships for beginning coders to help improve their skills. Internships are often available for college students, but many organizations offer internships to recent graduates or anyone new to the field with basic computer skills. Consider contacting tech organizations in your area or look for positions on technical job sites.
                    </p>

                    <h5>
                        <b>3. Volunteer or freelance</b>
                    </h5>
                    <hr/>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
                        Performing small projects on your own can provide valuable experience for a future junior developer job. Consider taking on freelance work by joining a freelance job site or discovering opportunities in your community. For example, you can offer to make the website for your sister's travel agency business or update a local store's software. You can also volunteer for local organizations to build experience and increase the projects you have in your portfolio.
                    </p>

                    <h5>
                        <b>4. Build a portfolio</b>
                    </h5>
                    <hr/>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
                        A portfolio is a collection of your previous work that you can show to an employer. Most junior developer jobs require you to submit a portfolio along with your resume. You can host your portfolio on a website, and in it, you can display code from projects you've worked on along with the final result and a short project brief detailing your goals and challenges. You could also write the code for your website so the page itself adds to your portfolio.
                    </p>

                    <h5>
                        <b>5. Find a related job</b>

                    <hr/>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
                        A junior developer is an entry-level job, but many positions require 3-5 years of experience in a related field. Freelance work can help you develop professional experience, or you can work at a job with a similar skill set. A technical job gives you more formal experience and may provide coding opportunities. Consider roles like:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Computer technician</li>
                            <li>Software tester</li>
                            <li>Web editor</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h5>
                        <b>6. Participate in an open-source project</b>
                    </h5>
                    <hr/>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
                        An open-source project is a collaborative coding project that uses publicly available source code anyone can modify. You can join an open-source project by finding internet communities or browsing coding web platforms. Participating in open-source projects can improve your coding, give you valuable experience and connect you to other coders.
                    </p>

                    <hr/>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
                        Expanding your network can be beneficial because it connects you with people in your industry who may know of hiring opportunities or participate in hiring themselves. Many coding and software development communities meet online to discuss topics in the field. Try to visit coding forums and websites or search computer science keywords on social media. You can also find in-person contacts by attending coding events or contacting experienced developers in your area to meet.

                    <hr/>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
                        Once you have experience, a portfolio and a professional network, you can apply for a job as a junior developer. Ask your network about any openings they know about and look for job postings on career websites. Consider searching for alternate job titles such as front-end developer or junior programmer. Remember to alter your application materials, like your resume and cover letter, for each job opportunity by including specific details about the role and company.

                    </h5>
                    <hr/>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
                        While some employers may be open to junior developers without a college degree, you may consider getting a degree in computer science. A degree allows you to learn code in a structured setting with qualified instructors. Colleges may also give you additional opportunities such as internships or networking events.
                    </p>

                    <h5>

                    <hr/>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
                        Attending events such as conventions, technical meet-ups or hackathons is a possible way to expand your professional network. Events enable you to meet other people interested in software development, ask questions to experts and learn more about coding. Hackathons, which are programming challenges, also provide you with projects you can add to your portfolio.
                    </p>

                    <h5>
                        <b>Post your open-source code publicly</b>

                    <hr/>

                    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
                        There are many online forums that allow you to post, modify, control and share your code. Many software development professionals use these hosting services to store their work and collaborate with others. Posting your code to a public forum may help you maintain best practices for coding and can show potential employers your knowledge and consistency.
